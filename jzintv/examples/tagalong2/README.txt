This directory contains "Tag-Along Todd 2", which expands the simple
Tag-Along Todd demo to a complete (if somewhat silly) game.

Tag-Along Todd 2:  

    Dateline:  Eastern Michigan, Spring 1983

    It's windy outside, and you're outside cleaning the yard.  Every so
    often, the wind blows a 12-pack of empty pop cans into your yard
    from the neighbor's yard.  You're minding your business cleaning the
    yard, but Todd wants to play.  Your family got an Intellivision for
    Christmas, and now you're the coolest kid on the block.  Todd's been
    hanging around you ever since.

    You really don't want to play with Todd, but your mom said to
    play nice.  So if Todd catches up to you, too bad -- you're playing
    with Todd today.  (At least maybe you can play Utopia or Baseball
    now that you'll have a second player.  Baseball's cool.  And Todd
    doesn't know how to steal bases like you do. *evil grin*)

    But really, you just want those pop cans.  Hey, at $0.10 a can 
    refund, (you're in Michigan after all) that's a lot of money for
    a kid your age.

    See how many cans you can clean up while completely avoiding Todd.


I encourage you to take this game and spruce it up various ways to get
a feel for how to do various things.  For instance, "tagalong2a" includes
a simple animation around the title on the title screen.  Ideas of 
things to try:

 -- Animate Todd and the player when they walk.  Right now they just
    float around the screen. 

 -- Have multiple "can" pictures that are selected between randomly
    when scattering cans on the screen.  Would make the screen less  
    monotonous.

 -- Draw up artwork to actually make it look like a lawn with maybe a
    fence or other things.  How many back yards are cement grey?  :-)
    
 -- Add obstacles in the lawn.

 -- Add distractions for Todd.

 -- Animate the cans littering the yard.

 -- Add more sound effects.

 -- Add music?
