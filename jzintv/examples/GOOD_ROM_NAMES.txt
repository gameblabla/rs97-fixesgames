This is a message intended for whoever maintains the "Good ROM" list
from the author of SDK-1600, Joseph Zbiciak.

Below are the names I'd prefer to see for the ROM images contained
in this archive.  And yes, I do want "SDK-1600" in each name, so that
it's clear that it's the version included in SDK-1600, and so that all
the files appear together in an alphabetical listing (kinda like
Song Player).

retain the copyright to them, and I'd like all of my Intellivision ROMs
