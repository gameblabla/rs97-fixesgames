  TEST_CART  -- Runs cart-reader through self-test
==============================================================================

This utility attempts to find a Nudds/Moeller style cartridge reader 
attached to a parallel port.  If it finds one, it will run the reader
through internal-loopback self test.

Note:  test_cart requires root privileges to run under Linux.
