On some systems, full-screen comes up in "portrait mode", and thus jzIntv's
output is rotated 90 degrees.  Try using a larger resolution (640x480)
to avoid this issue.

Not all Win keybindings are available because Windows intercepts them.
Win-M and Win-R are known to be affected. 

jzIntv's help output (jzintv --help) cannot be redirected to a file or
to a pager (e.g. "more").
