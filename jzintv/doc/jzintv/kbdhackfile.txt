 jzIntv Keyboard Hack Files
==============================================================================

Why "Keyboard Hack File"?  Because this is a quick-and-dirty mechanism
that I'm not particularly happy with.  It is, however, necessary and
functional, so here it is.

The syntax is simple.  The format is line-oriented, with each line
containing one of three things:  A comment, a MAP directive, or a
keybinding.

Comments start with a semicolon and terminate at the end of the line.
Comments may be on a line by themselves or may follow a key binding
or directive.

The MAP directive tells jzIntv what keyboard map to place the subsequent
bindings into.  This map remains in effect until a subsequent MAP
directive.  See jzintv/doc/jzintv/jzintv.txt for the default key bindings
in each map.  jzIntv supports four input maps.

Key bindings consist of a pair of identifiers on a line.  The first
identifier is the event input.  The second identifier is the event
action.  For example, to bind joystick 0's button #1 to the left
controller's top action button, you would write:

JS0_BTN_01 PD0L_A_T


jzIntv defines a very large number of event input names and event
actions that those inputs can be bound to.  For certain classes
of inputs and actions, jzIntv uses a regular scheme to name events.

 Event Inputs
--------------

Below is a table of event inputs that jzIntv defines.  You can also run
the program jzintv/rom/event_diag.rom to see in real time the event
inputs that jzIntv receives.  This can be useful for determining the
names SDL assigns to various special keys on some keyboards, or button
assignments on joysticks.

--------------
 Combo Events
--------------

You can combine pairs of events into "combination events."  jzIntv lets
you define up to 32 combo events named "COMBO0" through "COMBO31".
These events look like normal event inputs.  You can bind these to
event actions like any other event input.

To define a combo event, use the ADD_COMBO keyword:

    ADD_COMBO [combo_number] [event_input] [event_input]

For example:

    ADD_COMBO 0 LALT Q  ; LALT + Q now generates COMBO0


Combination events are composed of multiple event inputs arriving in
sequence.  jzIntv does its best to minimize glitches that occur when
events in a combo arrive separately.  You can control some of the
filtering jzIntv does with the "COMBO_DELAY" keyword.  This keyword
tells jzIntv how long, in milliseconds, to delay the first event of a
potential combo to all a second event to catch up to it:

    COMBO_DELAY 4.5   ; Delay potential combos by 4.5ms 

The default delay is 1ms.  


---------------
 Event Actions
---------------

Each event input can be assigned to trigger a single action.  jzIntv
defines the following actions:

NA      Ignore keystroke
QUIT    Quit jzIntv
RESET   Reset the Intellivision
PAUSE   Pause the game
MOVIE   Toggle movie recording
SHOT    Request a screen shot
HIDE    Disable screen updates while pressed
WTOG    Toggle between windowed/full-screen
BREAK   Interrupt the currently executing program (if debugger enabled)

KBD1    Switch to map 1
KBD2    Switch to map 2
KBD3    Switch to map 3

Controller inputs start with one of the following four prefixes:

PD0L_   Left controller, Master Component
PD0R_   Right controller, Master Component
PD1L_   Left controller, ECS
PD1R_   Right controller, ECS

Those four prefixes get combined with these suffixes:

KPx     Keypad key.  x=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,C,E
A_x     Action key.  x=T,L,R
D_ddd   Disc input.  ddd=E,ENE,NE,NNE,N,NNW,NW,WNW,W,WSW,SW,SSW,S,SSE,SE,ESE
J_ddd   Disc input from joystick.  ddd same as above.



ECS Keyboard inputs are pretty straight-forward:

KEYB_0 KEYB_1 KEYB_2 KEYB_3 KEYB_4 KEYB_5 KEYB_6 KEYB_7 KEYB_8 KEYB_9
KEYB_A KEYB_B KEYB_C KEYB_D KEYB_E KEYB_F KEYB_G KEYB_H KEYB_I KEYB_J
KEYB_K KEYB_L KEYB_M KEYB_N KEYB_O KEYB_P KEYB_Q KEYB_R KEYB_S KEYB_T
KEYB_U KEYB_V KEYB_W KEYB_X KEYB_Y KEYB_Z

KEYB_CARET KEYB_COMMA KEYB_CTRL KEYB_DOLLAR KEYB_DOWN  KEYB_ENTER
KEYB_EQUAL KEYB_ESC   KEYB_HASH KEYB_LPAREN KEYB_LEFT  KEYB_MINUS
KEYB_QUEST KEYB_PCT   KEYB_PLUS KEYB_PERIOD KEYB_SEMI  KEYB_QUOTE
KEYB_RIGHT KEYB_SHIFT KEYB_STAR KEYB_RPAREN KEYB_SLASH KEYB_SPACE
KEYB_SQUOTE KEYB_UP


---------------------------------
 Shift/Push/Pop:  Switching maps
---------------------------------

The Shift/Push/Pop actions benefit from additional explanation.
The intention of these actions is to allow people to use jzIntv's
multiple key maps more creatively.  For instance, on hand-held games,
the number of inputs available to the player may be very limited as
compared to the PC, since there is no keyboard.

The KBDx and SHFxx actions can be used a couple ways:  A momentary shift
from the current map into a new map, or to specify switching among a
set of maps in some sort of pattern.

For instance, suppose I want F5 to cycle between maps 0, 1 and 2.
One way to accomplish this is through these three bindings:

MAP 0
F5  KBD1
MAP 1
F5  KBD2
MAP 2
F5  KBD0


Suppose instead I want to have a key that behaves like a "shift" key,
momentarily placing the keyboard in another map.  The "PSHx" actions
save the current map on a one-deep stack when the key is depressed,
and pops the map number when it's released.  For example, to make the
Mac's CMD keys act like a shift key, shifting into map 3:

MAP 0
LCMD PSH3
RCMD PSH3
MAP 1
LCMD PSH3
RCMD PSH3
MAP 2
LCMD PSH3
RCMD PSH3
MAP 3
LCMD PSH3
RCMD PSH3


Alternately, if you want a "shift-lock" type of behavior, you can use
the PSHx actions with the POP action to get the desired effect.  The POP
action only operates on key-down, not key-up.   This works because each
key-down/key-up event gets interpreted in the currently active map.
Suppose I tweak the above binding like so:

MAP 0
LCMD PSH3
RCMD PSH3
MAP 1
LCMD PSH3
RCMD PSH3
MAP 2
LCMD PSH3
RCMD PSH3
MAP 3
LCMD POP
RCMD POP

What will happen is that the first press of LCMD/RCMD will push jzIntv
into map 3.  The first release will do nothing, since POP does nothing
on release.  The second push of of LCMD/RCMD will pop the keyboard map
stack, returning us to the previous map.  The second release will trigger
the PSH3 release action (which is to pop), but that's ok--popping an
empty keyboard map stack is harmless.
