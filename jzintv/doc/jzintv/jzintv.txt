 Introduction
--------------

jzIntv is, in part, an Intellivision emulator.  That is, jzIntv emulates
the hardware of the Intellivision Master Component and some of its
peripherals.

jzIntv is also portable.  Over the years, jzIntv has been ported to the
following platforms:

    DOS (now defunct)
    Linux (x86, x86-64, ARM (GP2X))
    FreeBSD (x86, x86-64, perhaps others)
    MacOS Classic (PPC-now defunct)
    MacOS X (PPC and x86)
    PSP (MIPS)
    Solaris (SPARC)
    Win32 (x86)

jzIntv is also a project.  The jzIntv project includes a complete
development kit.  It originally aimed to include comprehensive
documentation on the hardware, although now Kyle Davis' excellent
IntelliWiki has taken on that torch:  http://intelliwiki.kylesblog.com/

This document covers the emulator as opposed to the larger project.
See jzintv/doc/utilities and jzintv/doc/programming for details on
the development kit.

 Configuration 
---------------

At the moment, jzIntv does not have a configuration file.  Rather, jzIntv
configures itself entire through command-line flags and sane defaults.
jzIntv offers a wealth of command-line flags.  Run jzintv --help for
a complete and up-to-date list.

jzIntv also looks at an environment variable, JZINTV_ROM_PATH, to
determine where to look for ROM files.  Under Windows, you can set
this environment variable under the System Control Panel:  Click on
the "Advanced" tab, and click "Environment Variables."  Under other
UNIX-based OSes (including MacOS X), you can set environment variables
in your login scripts.

The ROM path consists of a list of directories to search for ROM images.
Directory names are separated by either a ':' (most OSes) or a ';'
(Windows).

 Playing Games
---------------

Using jzIntv is usually fairly simple.  First, obtain copies of
"exec.bin" and "grom.bin".  The easiest way is to purchase the latest
version of Intellivision Lives! from http://www.intellivisionlives.com/
and pull the files from there.

jzIntv is thoroughly a command-line program, although GUIs that wrap
jzIntv are available.

To start jzIntv, change directories to the directory containing your ROMs
(or alternately set JZINTV_ROM_PATH to point to that directory), and run
"jzintv [flags] romname" to start jzIntv.  If all goes well, you should
be staring at your game.  To change resolutions and other settings,
use the appropriate command-line flags.  Run "jzintv --help" to get list
list of flags.

Once in the game, jzIntv uses the following key bindings on most 
platforms:

Function/Special keys, all maps:
    F1              Quit
    F4              Break into debugger
    F5              Switch to keymap 0 (default keymap)
    F6              Switch to keymap 1 (left controller only for 1 player games)
    F7              Switch to keymap 2 (ECS keyboard keymap)
    F8              Shift to keymap 3 while held (command keys)
    F9              Toggle fullscreen/windowed 
    F10             Toggle movie recording 
    F11             Take screen shot
    F12             Reset emulator
    Pause           Pause the emulator
    PgUp            Increase volume
    PgDn            Decrease volume

Numeric Keypad, maps 0 and 1
    1-9             Left controller 1 - 9
    0               Left controller Clear
    .               Left controller 0
    Enter           Left controller Enter

Main Keyboard, map 0.  (Map 1 just moves right controller mappings to left.)
    0-9             Right controller 0 - 9
    -               Right controller Clear
    =               Right controller Enter
    Left Shift      Right controller top action buttons
    Left Alt        Right controller lower left action button
    Left Control    Right controller lower right action button

    Right Shift     Left controller top action buttons
    Right Alt       Left controller lower left action button
    Right Control   Left controller lower right action button

    Up Arrow        Left controller disc up
    Down Arrow      Left controller disc down
    Left Arrow      Left controller disc left
    Right Arrow     Left controller disc right


Fine-grain directional pad inputs:

    U   I   O
      \ | /
       \|/ 
    J --+-- K      Left controller disc
       /|\
      / | \
    N   M   , 
   
    W   E   R
      \ | /
       \|/ 
    S --+-- D      Right controller disc
       /|\
      / | \
    Z   X   C 



Map 2 configures the keyboard to behave as the ECS keyboard attachment.
Map 3 is for "command" keys.  If you press the Cmd key on a Mac or the
"Windows" key on a PC, or F8 on most platforms, jzIntv will be in Map
3 until you release the key.  The following command key bindings are 
currently defined:

    Cmd-Q   Quit
    Cmd-P   Pause
    Cmd-M   Movie
    Cmd-S   Screen shot
    Cmd-R   Reset
    Cmd-W   Toggle windowed/full-screen mode    

Not all Cmd bindings will work under Windows using the Windows key.  
This is because Windows itself captures these keystrokes.  Win-M and Win-R
are known to conflict with Windows' bindings.


--------------------
 Debugging Programs
--------------------

jzIntv also includes a simple monitor-style debugger that is useful for
debugging games running on the Intellivision.  The debugger has a handful
of commands for running, setting breakpoints, inspecting memory and so on.
It also offers some basic logging and profiling capability.

The debugger's commands are as follows:  (case insensitive)

    S<#>        Step <#> cycles, showing execution trace.
    R<#>        Run <#> cycles, suppressing execution trace.
    T           Run until JSR returns.  Works only if no data after JSR.
    D           Dump logs to disk
    B<#>        set Breakpoint at <#>
    N<#>        uNset breakpoint at <#>
    M<a> <#>    Show <#> words of memory around <a>.  <#> defaults to 64.
    U<a> <#>    uNassemble <#> instructions at <a>.  <#> defaults to 16.
    E<a> <#>    Enter the value <#> into address <a>.  Triggers side effects.
    P<a> <#>    Poke the value <#> into address <a>.  May update ROM.
    G<r> <#>    set reGister <r> to value <#>.
    H           toggle History logging
    W<a> <b>    toggle Watch status on addressed <a> through <b>.
    A           toggle memory Attribute discovery

For many of these commands, the arguments are optional.  The commands
will substitute in reasonable defaults.  Argument defaults:

    S           Step forever
    R           Run forever
    B, N        Set/uNset breakpoint at current PC
    M           Addr after prev dump, or 0 if first dump after stop.
    U           Addr after prev uNassemble, or PC if first unasm after stop.
    W           If only one argument given, toggles just that address.


The R, S and T commands execute the program.  The S command will print
each instruction and the register state as it executes.  The R command
will run the program silently, except for watch output.  The T command
is somewhat more complex.

The T command usually steps 1 instruction forward.  If the instruction
is a JSR, it will step over the JSR (unless the JSR is followed by data).
The T command also fails to differentiate between J and JSR.

The E and P commands allow changing memory.  The E command sends the
write as if the CPU sent it.  This can trigger bank switching, STIC mode
switching, and all sorts of other side effects.  The P command sidesteps
side effects.  It also allows modifying ROM in certain cases.

The H command enables register history tracking.  This can be very useful
for tracing down random crashes or other misbehavior in your program.
To view the register history, use the D command to dump out the current
state.  The file dump.hst will contain the register history.
