    CP-1610 Instruction Set Simulator 
    J. Zbiciak
===============================================================================

==============
 Introduction
==============

This document describes the current architecture of the CP-1610
instruction set simulator, as well as providing some documentation and
my current set of unknowns about the actual CPU itself.  This document
is, and probably will always be, far from complete.  :-)

===========================
 CPU Architecture Overview
===========================

The CP-1610 is a simple 16-bit CPU.  Here's a quick overview of its
features:

 -- Several addressing modes: Direct, Indirect, Indirect-Increment,
    Stack, Immediate, Implied, and Register.

 -- Eight 16-bit registers, R0-R7.  All 8 registers may be used for
    general arithmetic.  Some of the registers have special properties:

     -- R0 has no special purpose assigned to it.

     -- R1 though R3 are non-incrementing "data counters."  These can 
        be used as indirect-addressing registers.

     -- R4 and R5 are incrementing "data counters."  These can be used
        as indirect-increment-addressing registers.  Their values are
        incremented after every read or write.

     -- R6 is the "stack pointer."  As with R4 and R5, it is incremented
        after every indirect-addressing write.  However, it is decremented
        _before_ every read, thus providing an upward-growing stack.

     -- R7 is the program counter.  It can be either a source or a
        destination for most arbitrary arithmetic.  It cannot, however,
        be used as a data counter, although I suspect that is how
        "immediate mode" is implemented, upon examining the instruction
        encoding.  :-)

 -- A 10-bit primary opcode word.  This opcode word is describable using
    a handful of encoding formats that are reasonably regular.  

 -- External branch-condition support.  Four external pins can provide
    1 of 16 possible "branch conditions" that can be polled directly
    by the BEXT instruction.  This is potentially useful for
    microcontroller applications.  The Intellivision has these wired to 
    GND.

 -- Typical complement of arithmetic instructions -- ADD, SUB, CMP,
    AND, and XOR.  Missing is "OR", although XOR or ADD often suffice.

 -- Complete complement of shift/rotate instructions -- SLL, SLLC, 
    SAR, SARC, SLR, RRC, RLC, and byte SWAP.  The shifts and rotates
    can move one or two bits in one instruction, as well.


The CP-1610 is a 16-bit CPU that is designed to live in a world that
was mostly narrower than 16-bits at the time.  As a result, it sports
some interesting design decisions:

 -- Most instructions are 10 bits wide, to allow using 10-bit-wide
    ROMs to store programs.  In fact, instructions that were wider
    than 10-bits are (or can be) divided up into 10-bit-wide words
    for storage.  These 10-bit-wide quantities are referred to as
    "decles".

 -- Typical systems have a mix of 8-, 10-, and 16-bit wide peripherals
    and memories.  (The documentation also mentions 12- and 14-bit
    wide devices!)  Fortunately, devices narrower than 16 bits are
    accessed the same way as 16-bit wide devices, with the ms-bits
    of each word ignored/set to zero with pull-downs that are built
    into the device.

 -- To access 16-bit quantities in "narrow" memory, the SDBD prefix
    is provided.  It causes the next memory access to bring in two
    bytes, in little-endian order.  (Low byte first, high byte second).
    This instruction also causes immediate constants on immediate-mode
    instructions to span two bytes instead of one word.  More on this
    later.


Without further ado, I'd like to describe the basic opcode formats.
As you examine these, you may notice some cleverness about the encodings.
I'll point these out as I can.


The CP-1610 supports the following basic opcode formats:

  Branch Interrupt Modes   (ii)
 -------------------------------

  00   -- Do not change interrupt enable state
  01   -- Enable interrupts
  10   -- Disable interrupts
  11   -- Undefined/Reserved ?

 ------------
  SDBD notes
 ------------

  -- SDBD is supported on "immediate" and "indirect" modes only.

  -- An SDBD prefix on an immediate instruction sets the immediate constant
     to be 16 bits, stored in two adjacent 8-bit words.  The ordering is
     little-endian.

  -- An SDBD prefix on an indirect instruction causes memory to be
     accessed twice, bringing in (or out) two 8-bit words, again in
     little-endian order.  If a non-incrementing data counter is used,
     both accesses are to the same address.  Otherwise, the counter
     is post-incremented with each access.  Indirect through R6
     (stack addressing) is not allowed, although I suspect it works
     as expected (performing two accesses through R6).

 ------------------------
  Interruptibility notes
 ------------------------

  -- Interrupts always occur after an instruction completes.
     No instruction is interrupted midstream and completed later.

  -- Interrupts are taken after the completion of the next interruptible
     instruction.  A non-interruptible instruction masks interrupts
     through the transition from the current instruction to the next.

  -- When the processor takes an interrupt, the current PC value is
     pushed on the stack.  The address jumped to for the interrupt
     is provided by external hardware (similar to an 8080, if I
     recall correctly).  In the case of the Intellivision, the 
     EXEC ROM asserts an interrupt vector value of 01004h.

 ---------------------------------
  Status register/GSWD/RSWD notes
 ---------------------------------

  -- The status register has the following format:

         3   2   1   0       S -- Sign
       +---+---+---+---+     Z -- Zero
       | S | Z | O | C |     O -- Overflow
       +---+---+---+---+     C -- Carry

  -- The GSWD instruction stores the status word in the upper 4 bits of each
     byte of the destination register:

         F   E   D   C   B   A   9   8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
       | S | Z | O | C | - | - | - | - | S | Z | O | C | - | - | - | - |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

  -- The RSWD instruction reads the status word's new value from the upper
     four bits of the lower byte of the source register:

         7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
       | S | Z | O | C | - | - | - | - |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

 ------------
  SWAP notes
 ------------

  -- A "double" swap replicates the lower word in both bytes, and sets
     S and Z status bits based on the lower byte.  This is based on the 
     comments in the following code snippet from RUNNING.SRC in the dev kit:

           SWAP    R0, 2                 ; check bit #7
           BMI     @@exit                ; max speed is 127

 ------------------------
  General encoding notes
 ------------------------

  -- "Immediate" mode is encoded the same as "Indirect" mode, except that
     R7 is given as the indirect register.  I'm guessing R7 is implemented
     the same as R4 and R5, especially since MVOI does what you'd
     expect -- it (attempts to) write over its immediate operand!!!

  -- The PC value (in R7) used for arithmetic always points to the first
     byte after the instruction for purposes of arithmetic.  This is
     consistent with the observation that immediate mode is really
     indirect mode in disguise, with the instruction being only one word
     long initially.

  -- Several instructions are just special cases of other instructions,
     and therefore do not need special decoder treatment:

      -- TSTR Rx  -->  MOVR Rx, Rx  
      -- JR Rx    -->  MOVR Rx, R7
      -- CLRR Rx  -->  XORR Rx, Rx
      -- B        -->  Branch with condition code 0000 ("Always")
      -- NOPP     -->  Branch with condition code 1000 ("Never")
      -- PSHR Rx  -->  MVO@ Rx, R6
      -- PULR Rx  -->  MVI@ R6, Rx

  -- "Direct" mode is encoded the same as "Indirect" mode, except 000
     (which corresponds to R0) is encoded in the indirect register field.
     This is why R0 cannot be used as a data counter, and why it has no
     "special use."

  -- Relative branches encode their sign bit in the opcode word, rather
     than relying on a sign-extended relative offset in their second word.
     This allows +/- 10-bit range in a 10-bit wide memory, or +/-
     16-bit range in a 16-bit memory.  To avoid redundant encoding, the
     offset is calculated slightly differently for negative vs. positive
     offset:

      -- Negative: address_of_branch + 1 - offset
      -- Positive: address_of_branch + 2 + offset

     I'm guessing it is implemented about like so in hardware:

      -- offset == pc + (offset ^ (sign ? -1 : 0))

  Opcode Spaces
 ---------------

  I've divided the CP-1610 opcode map into 12 different opcode
  spaces.  (I really should merge the two separate Implied 1-op
  spaces into one space.  Oh well...)  In the descriptions below,
  "n/i" means "not interruptible".  Defined flags: Sign, Zero, Carry,
  Overflow, Interrupt-enable, Double-byte-data.  Interrupt-enable and
  Double-byte-data are not user visible.

     A source of "111" is actually a Immediate/Register opcode.
     R4, R5 increment after each access.  If the D bit is set, two
     accesses are made through the indirect register, updating the
     address if R4 or R5.  R6 increments after writes, decrements
     before reads.

     If DBD is set, the immediate value spans two adjacent bytes, little
     endian order.  Otherwise the immediate value spans one word.  This
     instruction really looks like indirect through R7, and I suspect
     that's how the silicon implements it.

So, now that you know all about the CP-1610 instruction set architecture,
let me describe how I simulate it.


========================
 CPU Simulator Overview
========================

The CP-1610 Simulator is divided into three sections.  These sections
are the Core CPU functions, the Opcode Decoding functions, and the Opcode
Execution functions.  The division of labor between these three sections
is as follows:

 -- The Core CPU functions: cp_1610.c / cp_1610.h
     -- Main CPU execution loop.
     -- Memory decoding and accessing functions.
     -- The CPU state structure, "struct cpu_t"

 -- The Opcode Decoder functions: op_decode.c / op_decode.h
     -- General opcode decoder which decodes arbitrary instruction words.
     -- Specialized decoders invoked by the general decoder.
     -- Opcode-specific decoder structures, "struct op_XXXXXX"
     -- Generalized "decoded instruction" structure, "struct op_decoded"
     -- Union of all opcode decoder structures, "union opcode_t"

 -- The Opcode Execution functions: op_exec.c / op_exec.h
    -- Instruction-specific functions for all CP-1610 instructions.

The main CPU structure (struct cpu_t) contains the entire state of the
CP-1610 machine, including its 8 registers, internal status bits, raw
memory, and memory accessor functions.  Also included are pointers to
"execute functions" and predecoded instructions that are used for 
actually executing the CP-1610 instruction set.


The main CPU execution loop performs roughly the following steps:

 1. Set the "interruptibility" bit equal to our interrupt enable bit.
 2. Call the execute function corresponding to our current PC value.
 3. Add elapsed microcycles to our total.
 4. If an interrupt is detected, and we're interruptible, start taking
    the interrupt.  (Push PC, set PC to interrupt vector.)
 5. If we have time left, go back to 1.

Notice that "read and decode instruction" does not appear anywhere in
this list.  Instruction decoding happens in a demand-driven fashion.
The CPU structure holds an array of instruction "execute functions"
which correspond to decoded instructions.  At initialization, these
functions are set to point to the generalized decoder "fn_decode", 
which is contained in "op_decode.c".  This forces each instruction to
be decoded the first time it is executed.

The opcode decoder "fn_decode" is charged with the responsibility of
decoding instructions, and potentially caching the decoded instruction
in the CPU structure.  These are the steps it takes to do this:

 -- Read the opcode word at the current PC
 -- Look it up in the 1024-entry "opcode format" table.
 -- Based on the format, determine how long the instruction is.
 -- Read up to two more words of the instruction, if needed.
 -- Place instruction words in "encoded" field of the "opcode_t" union.
 -- Call format-specific decoder function to actually perform the decode.
 -- Call the instruction execute function returned by the decoder.
 -- If the addresses spanned by the instruction are marked cacheable,
    store the execute function pointer in the CPU's execute array.
    Otherwise set the entry to "fn_decode".
 -- Return to the CPU execute loop.

What this provides is a demand-driven instruction decoder.  It works
by looking like an "execute function" even though it's a decoder, and
when its finished, it leaves the actual "execute function" pointer in
its place.

The "execute functions" have the responsibility of reading their
arguments (either from memory or from registers), performing the requested
operations, and storing their results.  This includes updating the PC and
toggling status bits.  An additional requirement is that the functions
return the total number of microcycles they required for execution,
so that the core CPU loop knows when to stop looping.

The "execute functions" call the core CPU's read and write functions
to access memory.  The CPU_RD and CPU_WR macros perform the necessary
address decoding and function calling.  In the case of jzIntv, these
macros call out to the "Peripheral Subsystem" (aka. Periph) to register
the reads and writes.  Periph is responsible for all address decoding,
etc.

In order to support self-modifying code, the CPU write functions
invalidate any decoded instructions stored at addresses that are written
to.  This is done by setting the decode function at the address and the
two before it to "fn_decode".
