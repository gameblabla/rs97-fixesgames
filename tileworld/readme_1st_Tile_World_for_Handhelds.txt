LIST OF IMRPOVEMENTS OF TILEWORLD FOR HANDHELDS OVER ORIGINAL TILEWORLD:
 (Courtesy of programmer Senor Quack, aka Dan Silsby dansilsby<AT>gmail.com):


* Simplified, menu-driven interface.

* All sprites graphics have been hand-shrunk and optimized for 320x240 screens.  
	The new game interface is reminescent of the Amiga/Lynx versions of Chip's 
	Challenge.  The sprites and blitting code have been modified to allow
	32-bit alpha-blended shadows instead of the ugly checkerboard shadows of
	the original Tileworld.

* Automatic configuration of level packs: No more editing configuration files!
	When first running the program, a folder is created in $HOME/.tworld containing 
	both $HOME/.tworld/data/ and $HOME/.tworld/sets/ folders.  
	
	As with the original PC Tileworld, you can place additional level packs,
	including the CHIPS.DAT file from the original Windows version of Chip's
	Challenge, into the $HOME/.tworld/data/ folder.

	Normally you would need to then manually create configuration files in
	the $HOME/.tworld/sets/ folder for this new levelset, one for running
	with the MS rulset and one for the Lynx rulset.

	Now, the game automatically creates these two configuration files for you
	and there is no need at all to even touch the sets/ folder and I recommend
	you do not.  Additionally, the game will now detect if the original
	CHIPS.DAT file is encountered and automatically add the "fixlynx=y" option
	to its Lynx configuration file (to fix a few minor glitches introduced by
	Microsoft's version of the levelset)
		
* You can control Chip from both the GCW DPAD, the A/B/X/Y buttons, as well 
	as the analog stick (after enabling it from the main menu).

* There is a optional > 30-minute musical soundtrack added from the chipmusic 
	artist Am-Fm (menu music from Chaozz of gp32x.com)

* Automatically remembers last levelpack and level played, so no need to 
	remember and go back to it. Automatically keeps track of scores and times 
	and number of levels in levels completed.

* Improved death sound.  The original death sound was much to distorted and 
	grating for my tastes.

* NOTE: The original Chip's Challenge level pack cannot be included because 
	of copyright restrictions. Instead, a few very good user-created levelpacks 
	have been included, including the best-of levelpacks CCLP2 and CCLP3.  
	A CCLP1 (replacement in spirit for original Chip's Challenge levelpack) 
	level pack is also in the works to be released sometime soon. 

	IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO PLAY THE ORIGINAL CHIP'S CHALLENGE: 
	you can find it by googling the term WITH QUOTES: 
	"Original Chip's Challenge Download".  Unzip the archive and upload the 
	CHIPS.DAT file inside to your $HOME/.tworld/data/ folder via FTP.  

	Many hundreds of community-created levelsets have been created and are
	available for download. The Chip's Challenge community is quite active
	and new levels are created every day.  You can enter your scores in
	online score-tracking sites and compete against the best.
