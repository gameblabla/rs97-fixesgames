Ganbare Natsuki-San
==========================

Ganbare Natsuki-San is a game by Alpha Secret Base (now inactive).
It was officially ported to Windows, Debian (as a binary), Mac OSX, GP2X,
as well as a proprietary port for Xbox 360.
Unofficially, it was ported to the Sony PSP, Wiz, Caanoo, Dingoo and OpenPandora.

My version is based on the (partially) translated PSP version.

Some bugs were fixed as well.
For example :
All the unofficials ports would load in memory the 8-bits colored backgrounds, 
even though the same backgrounds are available in 32-bits.
